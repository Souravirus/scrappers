# Google Keep Backup 

This Script uses Selenium Framework, to automatically scrape and save all the google Keep Notes from your Google Account.

I love sharing links via browser to save them to google keep , and thus even has an option to seperate links while saving

Just login to your google account on FireFox Web Browser and point the script towards it , and done!
